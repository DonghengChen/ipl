# A mechanization of a classical completeness proof for propositional intuitionistic logic

Completeness has been proved for intuitionistic logic with respect to
Kripke semantics by Kripke himself (1965) and others. The proof makes
use of classical reasoning at the metamathematical level.
Troelstra and Van Dalen [1, ch.2.6] utilize a slightly modified Henkin
construction that it is here mechanized for propositional logic. A variant of it is also found in Van Dalen [2, ch.5.3]. This repository contains a recent formalization of this classical proof of completeness for intuitionistic logic using the Lean theorem prover.
